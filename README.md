# Dotfiles

Version 2 - This is meant to be OS-agnostic and specifically _excludes_ my
neovim config (see [here](https://github.com/jonathanlamar/neovim) for that).

## How to install

1. Clone wherever you want.
2. Back up your dotfiles.
3. Put any bash/zshell rc contents specific to **your** computer in
   `~/.this_computer_profile`.
2. Run `./install.sh`.  The files in this repo will be copied to where they need
   to be.  It is up to you to install the programs and their dependencies.

## Dependencies
